                    <p>Conditional statements are useful when comparing one thing against another 
                     and you need the code to perform an action based on certain conditions.
                    The three different statements are the if statement, if else statement, and
                    else if statement.</p>

                    <p>Conditional statements use comparison operators when comparing values against one another.</p>

                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators" target="_blank">
                        <img src="/images/topic1-7.png" class="table">
                    </a>

                    <h3>If Statement</h3>
                    <img src="/images/topic1-8.png" class="snippet">
                    <p>In an if statement, if the comparison is true, the block of code will
                        be executed. If it is false, nothing will happen. In layman's terms: 
                        if true, do this. If false, do nothing. </p>
                    <h4>Example</h4>
                    <p>The easiest example that helps me understand conditional statements is by comparing age
                        to complete some action. For this example, we can imagine that the user is purchasing tickets
                        for an event. When they select their age, the corresponding price will be shown. We will say that
                        our user is 25 years old.
                    </p>
                    <div class="ticket-example">
                        <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/hannahtaylor/g5a3cvkh/2/embedded/js,html,result/dark/" 
                        allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allowpaymentrequest frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>The if statement includes the comparison between the user's age entry and the number 19. If the
                        user's entry is greater than or equal to 19, it will display the cost of $35.00. If it is less than 19,
                        nothing will occur and the default text in the paragraph will remain. It doesn't make a lot of sense to 
                        approach it this way, so we will move on to the if else statement.</p>
                    <h3>If Else Statement</h3>
                    <img src="/images/topic1-9.png" class="snippet">
                    <p>The if else statement will compare some values and if the comparison is true, the block of code
                        will be executed. If the comparison is false, it will move on to the next block of code under else.
                        In layman's terms: if true, do this. If false, do that.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Example</h4>
                    <p>We can change our example to include two different prices for two different age groups depending on our 
                        comparison statement. We will remove the $0.00 so that it says nothing when the user enters the page.
                        Ages 0-18 will cost $25 and ages 19-100 will cost $35.
                    </p>
                    <div class="ticket-example">
                        <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/hannahtaylor/db0j9ktx/embedded/js,html,result/dark/" 
                        allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allowpaymentrequest frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    </div>
                    <p>Since the price range for 0-18 year olds is $25, the comparison statement says if the user's entry is less than 19,
                        display the cost of $25. Else, display the price of $35. This comes in handy when you need to do different actions 
                        for two different values.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Else If Statement</h3>
                    <img src="/images/topic1-10.png" class="snippet">
                    <p>Finally, the else if statement allows us to provide multiple conditions if the previous one is false. You can include as
                        many else if statements as needed as long as it ends with an else statement. In layman's terms: if true, do this. Else if 
                        this condition is true, do this thing. Else do this thing because all of the above are false.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Example</h4>
                    <p>It is very likely that there would be more than 2 age groups for selling tickets. We can't forget the senior citizens! So now
                        the prices will be $25 for ages 0-18, $35 for ages 19-55, and $20 for ages 56 and above.
                    </p>

                    <p id="fix-overflow">This example is self explanatory, so no detailed explanation is needed. Moral of the if/if else/else if
                        story is that these can be useful for many reasons. Especially when there is a need for multiple outcomes based
                        on set conditions.
